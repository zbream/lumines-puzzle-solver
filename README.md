# lumines-puzzle-solver

This application helps solve puzzles in the game [Lumines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumines).
It doesn't actually _solve_ the puzzles algorithmically, however it assists in planning out the tiles necessary to fulfil a design.

1. Draw the needed design in the tiles.
Cells automatically fill in showing the full stacks of tiles needed.

1. Tiles that are vulnerable to clearing are marked with black bars.
Add filler cells (make sure they don't break the design!) or shift the design around to come up with the best way to approach the gameplay.

1. Play the game!
